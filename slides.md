Clicking on the "Export CSV" button should export all pages of data to a CSV file. 

It's best not to interact with the browser while this is happening. Click "Export CSV" and don't do anything until the file downloads. 

If there are many pages of results in this table of data, it could take a few seconds per page, so please be patient and let the operation finish.
