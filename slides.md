# Core features

<div class="dense">

- **Highly performant**: as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 30k requests per second.
- **Extensible**: fully extensible via hooks, plugins and decorators.
- **Schema based**: It isn't mandatory, but we recommend to use JSON Schema to validate your routes and serialize your outputs. Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant function.
